PascalCase for Component Files:

Use PascalCase for naming React component files. This means starting each word with an uppercase letter, including the first word.
Example: MyComponent.js
CamelCase for Utility Files:

Use camelCase for naming utility files or files that are not React components.
Example: apiUtils.js, helperFunctions.js
Descriptive Names:

Choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose or functionality of the file.
Example: LoginForm.js, UserList.js, styles.scss
Use Index.js for Entry Points:

When you have a directory containing multiple files and you want to export them from a single entry point, you can use index.js.
Example: components/index.js, utils/index.js
Prefixes or Suffixes for Specialized Files:

Sometimes, prefixes or suffixes can be useful to denote specialized files, such as test files or configuration files.
Example: MyComponent.test.js, App.config.js
Consistent Naming Conventions Across Files:

Maintain consistency across your project. If you choose a naming convention, stick to it throughout your project to avoid confusion.
Avoid Special Characters and Spaces:

Avoid using special characters and spaces in file names to ensure compatibility across different platforms and tools.
Follow Language or Framework Conventions:

If you're working in a team or contributing to an existing project, consider following any established naming conventions or guidelines specific to that project or organization.
